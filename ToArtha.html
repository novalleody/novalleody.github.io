      Baby,<br/><br/>even with all this distance between us, i want you to know that my heart has never taken a single step away from you. you are constantly on my mind, in the quiet moments and in the chaos, and my feelings for you remain steady, calm, and real.<br/><br/>you don’t have to be strong all the time. you don’t have to have everything figured out. whatever you’re feeling right now... the confusion, the tiredness, the heaviness... it’s okay. there is no pressure here. just know that you are allowed to feel, and you are allowed to take your time.<br/><br/>i’m here for you in the ways that matter. i'm here to listen, to wait, to understand, and to stay. even when words feel hard to find, even when the days feel long, you are never facing them alone. my care for you is patient, gentle, and constant.<br/><br/>i hope that every challenge you face, every lonely and stormy day will remind you that my love is with you... unwavering, gentle, and always here to hold you up. i'm not going anywhere. distance doesn’t change my commitment to you, and time only deepens it.<br/><br/>take things one step at a time, baby. i believe in you, i care about you deeply, and i’m holding space for you... today, tomorrow, and for as long as you need.<br/><br/>i hope our love keeps bringing us closer, filling our days with warmth, trust, and happiness. babe we're learning, growing and choosing each other every day.
     "always excited for everything ahead of us, no matter how long or how far baby"
    <br/><br/>ALWAYS,<br/>ODENG<br/><br/></p>
    <p>
      semoga tiap hari bawa seenggaknya sedikit senyum dan harapan baru buatmu, Baby. Amin.
